  About Me
</h1>

<p>
I am 29 years old and my name is Shinya Nakamura. After graduating from college, I worked as a physical therapist in hospitals, clinics, and home nursing.
Since July 2022, I have been practicing coding and studying web production on my own. I usually keep in touch with the latest technologies and hone my skills through development.
Please see my developed works below.
I am working hard every day to develop my career as a web engineer.
I am very interested in front-end and back-end development. I especially like React and Typescript. i am not good at AWS, but i am learning it steadily.
I will make an effort to help people 1:n instead of 1:1 for the rest of my life.

    <p>This is a web application for healthcare professionals. Until now, we used to print out evaluation forms and write them down as we went along. This was an inefficient situation. We have seen situations where evaluations were not performed due to inefficiency. This reduces medical effectiveness. This application can input numbers and evaluations on the front end and output them to PDF. We were able to improve efficiency, go paperless, and gain contributions to medical effectiveness.</p>

    <p>We have developed our own automated submission of X. There are other multifunctional tools on the market, but all of them are paid. Therefore, we combined the minimum necessary functions. We were able to create a very easy to use and modern system.</p>
